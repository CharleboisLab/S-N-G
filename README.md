# S-N-G
Simulation code for deterministic and stochastic population models of the S-N-G transition during drug treatment. Code was written by Joshua Guthrie and questions regarding the code should be directed to jdguthri@ualberta.ca.

Deterministic simulation code was written in MATLAB, stochastic simulation code was written in C. Each folder contains code used for both constant and flucuating drug conditions.
